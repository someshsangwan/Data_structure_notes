// A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems. 
// The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem.
//  for example we have some coins and we want to make a toal amount of something ruppes, so if we want to it by using minimum no. coin so first we use max amount coin


// Different Types of Greedy Algorithm
// Selection Sort
// Knapsack Problem
// Minimum Spanning Tree
// Single-Source Shortest Path Problem
// Job Scheduling Problem
// Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
// Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
// Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
// Huffman Coding
// Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
