// stack is a linear data structure that serves a collections of data type , it is a lifo(last in first out) type 
//data structure;
// all operation perform in o(1) time complexity;
// we can implement stack by using an array and by linked list;
// if we know size of stack we will implement stack by using array 
// if we dont size of stack in advanced we will use Linked list ;
// all in o(1);
