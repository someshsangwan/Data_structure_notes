question - what is heap 
answer- heap is a complete binary tree that comes with a heap order property;

question - what is a complete binary tree
answer -  1) every level is completely filled except leaf node;
        2) Nodes always added from left side;

question -  what is heap order property 
answer  - max heap and min heap

question - what is max heap - in tree root value is always greater than its child;
question - what is min heap - in tree root value is always less than its child;
