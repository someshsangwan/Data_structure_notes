Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration. 
Insertion sort works similarly as we sort cards in our hand in a card game. We assume that the first card is already sorted then,
 we select an unsorted card.

// in every round we fit a card to its right position.
// isme swap nhi sidha shift krke gusa dete h

//time - o(n^2)-- best-o(n) worst-o(n^2);
