//is it possible if we divide array into two part whose some is equal ------ return yes if possible else No ;
//its application of last question --
//here s1 and s2 is two set array sum is s
//s1+s2=s
//s1==s2
//s1+s1=s
//s1=s/2;
//if arr sum is odd return false it means there is no possible s1 ,s2;
// if sum is even try to find set wjose sum is equal to s/2;
// now it is same as previous question ;
